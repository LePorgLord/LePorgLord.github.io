          <h3>Stamps, Arkansas</h3>
          <p>
              Stamps, a dusty Arkansas settlment, was the childhood hometown of Maya Angelou and her brother Bailey, home to the Wm. Johnson General Merchandise Store, owned by their grandmother, Annie Henderson. From age 3 when Maya arived to her depature at age 12, Maya felt a perpertual stranger in Stamps. Growing up during the era of Jim Crow in the South, Stamps was heavily segregated and racsit violence a constant threat. The town lay divided by race, consisting of the impoverished Black section of town, while the wealthier white area lay across the train tracks. Stamps' Black neighbrhood was one based on cotton picking and agriculture, the Store serving as a hub with its frozen goods, radio, and provisions. Meanwhile, white Stamps existed in its own universe, with large houses, trimmed lawns, electricity, and lynching.

          <h3>St. Louis</h3>
          <p>
              Regarded by Maya as a foriegn country, St. Louis was a bustling city filled with lights, skyscrapers, and saloons which catered to those sick of Prohibition, a far cry from rural Stamps. There, Maya stayed with her mother’s family, witnessing the city’s nightlife, riding in elevators, reading comics, and experiencing snow for the first time in her life. St. Louis, for all its wonder, was also the site of one of horror, where Mr. Freeman raped 8-year old Maya, rendering her mute for months as she struggled with trauma and his murder by her uncles in revenge.

          <h3>San Francisco</h3>
          <img id = "sanfran" src = https://s.hdnux.com/photos/57/31/06/12423600/3/rawImage.jpg/>
          <p>
            San Francisco was the setting for most of Maya's adolecent years, one which she described as a "... city was a state of beauty and a state of freedom." Lving in a boaring house her mother owned and operated, Maya achieved academic prowess in Mrs. Kirwin's class at George Washington High School, eventually earning a scolarship to the California Labor School at age 14. Meanwhile, Maya discovered the thrilling Robin Hoods of the Black Underground, where she listened to tales of bigoted, wealthy white men being humilated and duped by Black con-artists of her Mother's aqaintance. Later, Maya would undermine racism though deception, going to work as the first Black trolley operator in San Francisco, ferrying passengers from dawn to dusk at age 16. As a teenageer, San Francisco represented new possibilities and freedom; from the South, from poverty, from the feeling of being an outsider. However, San Franciso, though virbant, still bore the scars of its era. Just recovered from the Great Depression and the outbreak of WWII in the U.S., the city found istelf awash with new immigrant oustiders seeking to take the former homes and buisnesses owned by Japanese-Americans now imprisoned in internment camps.
