          <p>
            Bailey Johnson Jr. was Maya's older brother and her closest freind. Two years her senior, Maya looked up to Bailey, an easy-going, charismatic and intelligent figure. Growing up in Stamps, AK, Bailey and Maya were inseperable, playing, reading and helping their grandmother run the Store. However, upon meeting his father, and more importantly, his mother, Bailey Jr. became enamored with his perfect "Mother Dear" and his return to Stamps was difficult, marked by the terrifying realziations of racism and the confusion of adolensce. Later on, as a teenager in San Franciso, Bailey's love for his mother devolved into a percived struggle between her male companions and him for her love, emulating them with tragic consqeuences. This conflict between him and his beloved mother eventually boiled over into his exile from her house. Bailey enlisted in the navy during the then-ongoing WWII, returning to celebrate the birth of his sister's son.

          <p>
            The mother of Maya and Bailey Johnson, Vivian Baxter was both tough as nails and yet fun-loving, carying a pistol while dancing till midnight. She was absent for most of Maya's childhood, having divorced Bailey Sr. and sending the children to live with their father's mother in Stamps, AK. However, meeting her mother was an astonishing experince, for she was beutiful and powerful, sharing a close bond with her indimidating brothers. Bailey felt utmost adoration for his mother, who shared "whiter" traits, nameley straighter hair and lighter skin, while Maya was somewhat more distant, almost indmidated by her mother's percived "perfection". It was Maya's own mother, unfotunately, who introduced the young girl to her date Mr. Freeman, who raped Maya at the tender age of 8. Later, Maya and her brother moved to California, settling with Mrs. Baxter in San Francisco. Here, Maya's relatationship with her mother would deepen as she forged her own path in life, encouraged by her mother's independent nature while Bailey would drive further apart as he grew to vie with other men for his mom's love.

          <h3>Annie Henderson<br><i>also known as</i> "Momma"</h3>
        <p>
          Annie Henderson was the mother of Bailey Johnson Sr and Uncle Wille, having lived in Stamps all her life, managing the Wm. Johnson General Merchandise Store. She acted as a surogate mother for Bailey and Maya until their adolence, instructing them to be dedicated learners and disiplined children. She was extremely strict and very religious, always present at Chruch on Sundays and ensured that her grandchildren behaved in accordance with the bible. A central figure of the Stamps Black comunity, she was well regarded by all of Black Stamps. While Mrs. Hederson would bear the rude and raucous taunts of the "po'white'trash" children, but would be forceful when needed, such as when she demanded that the white Denstist Lincoln repay his debt to her by compensating in full for Maya's tooth surgery if he would not perform it himself becuase of his bigotry.

          <h3>Bailey Johnson Sr.</h3>
          <p>
            Maya and Bailey Jr's father, Bailey Jr., was a towering figure whose aspriations always exceeded the reality of the hardships of racism and poverty. The son of Annie Henderson, Bailey Sr. married and divorced Vivian Baxter, sending their two young children to live with his mother in Stamps, Ak while he remained in California. His absence only made him a stranger to his then 8-year old daughter, who was terrified of this giant with his shiny grey car, suit, and imaculate speech, pepered with "errs" and "ahhs". A couple of years later, she visited her father in Southern California, where she clashed with his girlfriend Dolores, a pompous and controlling figure. After a fateful crash with her drunken father in Mexico, only to leave her father for good after a violent fight with Dolores. While skilled, sociable and eloquent, Bailey Sr. was a poor father who seemed more akin to a passerby than a parent.
