            "The fact that the adult American Negro female emerges a formidable character is often met with amazement, distaste, and even belligerence. It is seldom accepted as an inevitable outcome of the struggle won by survivors and deserves respect if not enthusiastic acceptance." (Aneglou, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, P. 272)

            “Oh, Black known and unknown poets, how often have your auctioned pains sustained us? Who will compute the lonely nights made less lonely by your songs, or by the empty pots made less tragic by your tales?” (Angelou, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, P. 184)

            Maya and Bailey Jr's father, Bailey Jr., was a towering figure whose aspriations always exceeded the reality of the hardships of racism and poverty. The son of Annie Henderson, Bailey Sr. married and divorced Vivian Baxter, sending their two young children to live with his mother in Stamps, Arkansas while he remained in California. His absence only made him a stranger to his then 8-year old daughter, who was terrified of this giant with his shiny grey car, suit, and imaculate speech, pepered with "errs" and "ahhs". A couple of years later, she visited her father in Southern California, where she clashed with his girlfriend Dolores, a pompous and controlling figure. After a fateful crash with her drunken father in Mexico, only to leave her father for good after a violent fight with Dolores. While skilled, sociable and eloquent, Bailey Sr. was a poor father who seemed more akin to a passerby than a parent.

          <p>The Black artistocrat of Stamps, Mrs. Flowers was the epitome of elegance and human dignity. One of the most defining figures in young Maya's life. As a Black woman who dressed, behaved, and lived like royalty, Mrs. Flowers redefined the concept of who a Black woman could be for Maya, shattering the notions of Black female inferiority that systemic racism propogated. Mrs. Flowers imbued in Maya a lifelong love for literature and an unwareing pride in her identity. With her graciousness, Mrs. Flowers taught Maya how to sew and bake, how to be witty and corteous. However, the apreciation, the love and affection Mrs. Flowers provided to Maya as she baked the girl cookies and listened to her read her favorite book were life changing, inspiring Maya with newfound self-confidence.</p>
