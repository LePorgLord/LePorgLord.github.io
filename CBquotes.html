            "The fact that the adult American Negro female emerges a formidable character is often met with amazement, distaste, and even belligerence. It is seldom accepted as an inevitable outcome of the struggle won by survivors and deserves respect if not enthusiastic acceptance." (Aneglou, <u>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</u>, P. 272)

            “Oh, Black known and unknown poets, how often have your auctioned pains sustained us? Who will compute the lonely nights made less lonely by your songs, or by the empty pots made less tragic by your tales?” (Angelou, <u>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</u>, P. 184)

            “To be left alone on the tightrope of youth unknowing is to experience the excruciating beauty of full freedom and the threat of eternal indicison. Few, if any, survive their teens. Most surrender to the vague but murderous pressure of adult conformity. It becomes easier to die and avoid conflicts than to maintain a constant battle with the superior forces of maturity.” (Angelou, <u>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</u>, P. 271)

            “As quickly as I understood that I had not reached my home, I sneaked away to Robin Hood’s forest and the caves of Alley Oop where all reality was unreal and even that changed every day. I carried the same shield I had used in Stamps: ‘I didn’t come to stay.’” (Angelou, <u>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</u>, P. 72)

            “If growing up is painful for the Southern Black girl, being aware of her displacement is the rust on the razor that threatens the throat. It is an unnecessary insult.” (Angelou, <u>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</u>, P. 4)

            “Childhood’s logic never asks to be proved (all conclusions are absolute). I didn’t question why Mrs. Flowers had singled me out for attention, nor did it occur to me that Momma might have asked her to give me a little talking to. All I cared about was that she had made tea cookies for <i>me</i> and read to <i>me</me> from her favorite book. It was enough to prove that she liked me.> (Angelou, <u>I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings</u>, P. 101)
