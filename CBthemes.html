          <h3>Racism</h3>
          <p>
    Racism is the principal theme of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, affecting every character, setting, and detail in some manner. From the beginning, racism assaults Maya with an identity crisis, she writes, in the prologue, of how she as a child wished she were a wealthy white girl; a cruel fantasy imposed on her through centuries of systemic oppression. This adversity is one not of outwards discrimination by others, as is typically depicted, but instead an instrinsic one, representative of how deep racism’s roots are. Of course, all the other characters experience racism in some form or another. For example, Bailey Jr, whose own survival as a Black male depends on walking the fine line between an ignorance of racism and the unspoken societal rules of the Jim Crow era, and the knowledge of a system against which he would be killed in trying to dismantle. Likewise, his father, Bailey Sr., must contend with a in spite of the limited opportunities available to him based on his race. Not only due the characters experience racism directly, but the impact of race is felt in the settings, most notably WWII-era San Francisco. In the aftermath of the Pearl Harbor attack, all Japanese-Americans are rounded up and imprisoned in internment camps, leaving San Francisco with eager newcomers looking to profit off the spoils of the property left behind by the victims of executive order 9066. Their absence is reflected upon by Maya, noting how instead of outrage towards the racist policy, most Black San Franciscans were complacent. For them, the removal of Japanese-Americans was an opportunity to forge a better life, escaping from the South to fill jobs left open by the war and control one’s own destiny. Furthermore, the removal of Japanese-Americans was far easier to ignore for they were not white, and there was no fear of retribution after the war. This San Francisco racial dynamic, in which oppressed Black Americans become silent oppressors, explores the existence of structural racism on a macroscopic level. The conditions which forced so many Black San Franciscan’s to immigrate there were the direct result of racism, from squalor induced by centuries of enslavement and decades of Jim Crow laws to the appeal of succession at the behest of another oppressed minority. Ultimately, the disenfranchisement of one group for the benefit of another is what sustains the system itself, and is a recurring observation throughout the book.

            <h3>The Power of Black Women</h3>
            <p>
    Throughout I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, the most powerful and impactful figures in Maya Angelou’s life have been the Black women who have raised, loved, and educated her. Maya’s grandmother, her mother and Mrs. Flowers are by far the greatest influences on her life, and though they are each faced with the immeasurable burden of racial and sexist bigotry, they are the most resilient and dignified characters of her memoir. Annie Henderson, Maya’s grandmother, is a strict yet compassionate disciplinarian who raised her grandchildren to value Black excellence, developed their stellar math skills and work ethic by helping her run the store, and ensured they were always well-dressed, well-spoken, and religiously observant. From her introduction, Maya introduces Momma as an entrepreneur and a pillar of the community, a woman who single handedly built the community hub of Black Stamps from a small lunch cart she ran, selling food and refreshments to field workers. Her power extended beyond, for by loaning money to white Stamps residents during the Great Depression, she commanded enough influence to overcome racial barriers and persuade the white, prejudiced Dentist Lincoln to compensate for her granddaughter’s tooth surgery as a means of paying off his debts if he refused to do so himself. Maya’s mother, on the other hand, while a free-spirited, more liberal individual, was no less powerful. Toting a gun for protection, and having owned a business and working several jobs, she had an unbridled air of confidence and never settled for what she found insufficient. Always a socialite, she wielded sway over her many friends and associates in the saloons of San Francisco and St. Louis, commanding the respect of plethoras of men. She also treated Maya as an adult and an equal, earning her daughter’s mutual appreciation as she enabled her daughter to learn the ways of self-sufficiency and perseverance through work and independence, rather than demand obedience through parental control. Much like her mother, Vivian Baxter, Maya Angelou was taught how to support and uplift herself, emerging a diamond from the heat and pressure of racism and sexism. Finally, the elegant and compassionate Mrs. Flowers taught Maya self-confidence through the joy of literature. Merely her existence, a Black woman who dressed, spoke, and lived like royalty, broke young Maya’s visions for what a Black woman could be in a Southern, Jim Crow-era town. Wherever Mrs. Flowers went, she exudes an air of commanding dignity and grace, truly the Queen of her town. Yet by taking an interest in Maya and listening to her as she read, baking her cookies and imbuing Maya with the knowledge that she was an important human being, scraping away any preconceived inhibitions that resulted from the feelings of inferiority generated by her social status. In conclusion, these Black women who molded Maya into the celebrated activist and author she is represent the theme of Black Female empowerment, the survivors of the deepest societal trauma who have endured to achieve far beyond the confines imposed upon them.

            <h3>Growing Up</h3>
            <p> 
Predominantly a memoir focused on her childhood, Maya Angelou discusses one of the core aspects of the experiences of all humans in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings: growing up. As the story progresses, Maya’s identity begins to ferment, changing from a perpetual outsider, unsure who she is to an intellectual, a mother, a proud and confident Black woman. How she is shaped by her youth is the core focus of the book, and one of its central themes. Her loss of innocence and perpetual feeling of displacement, of being the outsider, are universally resonant, and yet in her instance, so extreme. As a child, she writes of her views in the moment, and we, the readers are able to experience how she as a human being evolves over time. When she first encounters her father, she recounts the surprise, the astonishment, the indignity of having her secret code of pig latin broken, a sign of the untrustworthiness of adults. Later, as a teenager, her worldview is altered, she describes adolescence as a tightrope upon which one must avoid the pressures of adulthood, a freedom that comes at the expense of waging a war against the far more powerful forces of maturity. Her reflection of her thoughts as a child, how her mind works, enables the reader to not only connect with the universal theme present but also to better understand her metamorphosis by the various factors which have transformed Marguerite Johnson into Maya Angelou.
