</h3>
<p>
  Maya Angelou was a multitalented human being, a poet and a playwright, an author and an activist, an inspiration to countless people across the globe. She was born Marguerite Johnson in St. Louis in 1928 to Vivian Baxter and Bailey Johnson Sr. She would be raised in Stamps, Arkansas with her older brother Bailey, by her grandmother, experincing the racism and sexism of the Jim Crow era as well as the poverty of the Great Depression. At seven years old, she would endure more trauma after being raped by her mother's boyfriend, Mr. Freeman. She would later move to Los Angeles and then San Francisco as a tennager to live with her mother, who imparted on her an independent mind and fierce spirit. In San Francisco, she attended George Washington High School, and attained a scholarship to the Calafornia Labor School at age 14 where she embraced the theater. She would become the first Black cable car conductor in San Francsico at age 16, and would giver birth to her son Guy in 1944. During the 50s would perform as an actor in such plays as Porgy and Bess. As a civil rights activist and a member of the Harlem Writer's Guild, Mrs. Angelou employed her theatrical talents to write and produce a musical for the cause, becoming close freinds with Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. and Malcom X. In 1969, she published I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, a memoir of her childhood. I Know Wny the Caged Bird Sings would become her most popular book, acheiving a record as the longest-running nonfiction paperback in the New York Times' history, and would serve as an inspiration to readers everwhere including Oprah Winefrey. Maya's monumental impact was recognized with a National Medal of the Arts in 2000 and a Presidental Medal of Freedom in 2011. She passed away on May 28th, 2014.
